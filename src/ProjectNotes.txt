Goal: To build a tool to download images between dates to a folder so that I may use them on my desktop.

Images I chose are from the Astronomy Picture of the Day Archive.
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html

Format for each picture URL is https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/apYYMMDD.html where:
    YY is the 2-digit year
    MM is the 2-digit month, including leading zeros
    DD is the 2-digit date, including leading zeros

    200403 is the proper date format for the image on April 3rd, 2020

Pictures are labeled with some title associated. They are not archived in a way to allow the retrieval by date.

- Every page has only one picture on it, so inspecting the HTML source has the image URL in the IMG SRC tag.
- URL for source:
        view-source:https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/apYYMMDD.html
- URL for image is:
        https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/<image/year/name.jpg>, where <> encloses the IMG SRC tag in the HTML

Example:
        view-source:https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap200221.html
